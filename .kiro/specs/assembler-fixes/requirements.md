# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the assembler, ELF generator, and PE generator that prevent the creation of valid and functional executable files. The current implementation has several bugs in opcode encoding, instruction parsing, section layout, and executable generation that need to be fixed to produce working binaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Assembler Opcode Encoding

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the assembler to correctly encode instructions into machine code, so that the generated binary contains valid opcodes that can be executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assembler encodes an instruction THEN it SHALL use the correct bit layout for the target architecture
2. WHEN parsing operands THEN the assembler SHALL correctly distinguish between registers, immediate values, and memory references
3. WHEN encoding multi-operand instructions THEN the assembler SHALL properly encode both source and destination operands
4. WHEN handling memory dereferences like [message_len] THEN the assembler SHALL resolve them to the correct memory addresses
5. WHEN processing labels THEN the assembler SHALL correctly calculate and patch forward references

### Requirement 2: Fix ELF Generation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ELF generator to create valid executable files, so that the generated binaries can be loaded and executed by the operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating ELF headers THEN the generator SHALL set correct magic numbers, machine types, and entry points
2. WHEN creating program headers THEN the generator SHALL properly align segments and set correct permissions
3. WHEN laying out sections THEN the generator SHALL ensure proper memory alignment and virtual addresses
4. WHEN creating symbol tables THEN the generator SHALL include all necessary symbols with correct addresses
5. WHEN writing section data THEN the generator SHALL maintain proper file offsets and sizes
6. WHEN setting up dynamic linking THEN the generator SHALL create valid import/export tables if needed

### Requirement 3: Fix PE Generation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PE generator to create valid Windows executable files, so that the generated binaries can run on Windows systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating DOS header THEN the generator SHALL set correct magic numbers and NT header offset
2. WHEN creating NT headers THEN the generator SHALL set proper machine type, subsystem, and entry point
3. WHEN laying out sections THEN the generator SHALL align sections to proper boundaries and set correct characteristics
4. WHEN creating import tables THEN the generator SHALL generate valid import directory structures
5. WHEN writing section data THEN the generator SHALL maintain correct file and virtual addresses
6. WHEN setting up relocations THEN the generator SHALL handle address fixups correctly

### Requirement 4: Improve Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when assembly or generation fails, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assembly fails THEN the assembler SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the problem location
2. WHEN ELF generation fails THEN the generator SHALL report detailed error information
3. WHEN PE generation fails THEN the generator SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL check for common issues like missing entry points or invalid opcodes
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the generation process

### Requirement 5: Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the assembler to work correctly on different platforms, so that I can develop on any system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the assembler SHALL generate correct PE executables
2. WHEN running on Linux THEN the assembler SHALL generate correct ELF executables
3. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL use platform-appropriate path separators
4. WHEN setting executable permissions THEN the system SHALL use platform-specific methods
5. WHEN dealing with endianness THEN the system SHALL handle byte order correctly for the target architecture
